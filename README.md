# Guitarc

Guitarc is designed to help guitarists organize their musical journey.
This app allows a user to save and update chords as they are learned
by attaching finger positioning images to the "Chord Library" page.
Guitarc also enables the creation of a collection of songs a guitarist has learned or is practicing with the option to attach Chords from their
Chorld Library.

## Next Steps

There are so many cool features I can continue to add with this project, including:

- Add an ability to organize chords belonging to a song in chronological order
- Display the names of the songs attached to each chord on the Chord Library Page
- Indicate whether or not a chord is "learned" in the Song Panel Section
- Implement test cases to ensure code is functioning properly
- Properly size images uploaded by a user for continuity and to prevent potential complexities with the server
